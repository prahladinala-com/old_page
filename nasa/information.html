                                    responsible for science and technology related to air and space. The Space Age started in 1957 with the 
                                    launch of the Soviet satellite Sputnik.</h5>
                    
                                <h5>NASA opened for business on Oct. 1, 1958. The agency was created to oversee U.S. space exploration and 
                                    aeronautics research.</h5>
                    
                                <h5>The administrator is in charge of NASA. The NASA administrator is nominated by the president and confirmed 
                                    by a vote in the Senate.</h5>

                                <h5>Many people know something about NASA’s work. But most probably have no idea about how many different things 
                                    the agency does. Astronauts in orbit conduct scientific research. Satellites help scientists learn more about 
                                    Earth. Space probes study the solar system and beyond. New developments improve air travel and other aspects 
                                    of flight. NASA is also beginning a new program to send humans to explore the Moon and Mars. In addition to 
                                    those major missions, NASA does many other things. The agency shares what it learns so that its information 
                                    can make life better for people worldwide. For example, companies can use NASA discoveries to create new 
                                    spinoff products.</h5>

                                    NASA helps teachers prepare students who will be the engineers, scientists, astronauts and other NASA workers 
                                    of the future. They will be the adventurers who will continue exploration of the solar system and universe. 
                                    NASA has a tradition of investing in programs and activities that inspire students, educators, families and 
                                    communities in the excitement and discovery of exploration. NASA offers training to help teachers learn new 
                                    ways to teach science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The agency also involves students in NASA 
                                    missions to help them get excited about learning.

            <h5>
                NASA’s Headquarters is in Washington, D.C. The agency has nine centers, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and seven
                 test and research facilities located in several states around the country. More than 17,000 people work for 
                 NASA. Many more people work with the agency as government contractors. These people are hired by companies 
                 that NASA pays to do work. The combined workforce represents a variety of jobs. Astronauts may be the best-known
                  NASA employees, but they only represent a small number of the total workforce. Many NASA workers are scientists 
                  and engineers. But people there hold many other jobs, too, from secretaries to writers to lawyers to teachers.
            </h5>

            <h2>What Has NASA Done?</h2>
            <br>
            <h5>
                When NASA started, it began a program of human spaceflight. The Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs helped NASA 
                learn about flying in space and resulted in the first human landing on the Moon in 1969. Currently, NASA has 
                astronauts living and working on the International Space Station.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                NASA’s robotic space probes have visited every planet in the solar system and several other celestial bodies. 
                Telescopes have allowed scientists to look at the far reaches of space. Satellites have revealed a wealth of 
                data about Earth, resulting in valuable information such as a better understanding of weather patterns.
            </h5>
            <h5>
                NASA has helped develop and test a variety of cutting-edge aircraft. These aircraft include planes that have 
                set new records. Among other benefits, these tests have helped engineers improve air transportation. NASA 
                technology has contributed to many items used in everyday life, from smoke detectors to medical tests.
            </h5>
            <h5>In 2018, NASA celebrated its 60th anniversary.</h5>
